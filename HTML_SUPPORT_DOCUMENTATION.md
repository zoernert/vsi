# HTML File Support Implementation

## Overview
Added comprehensive support for HTML file processing in the VSI document management system. HTML files are now automatically converted to Markdown format before being indexed into the Qdrant vector store.

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified

1. **`src/services/documentProcessor.js`**
   - Added `.html` and `.htm` to supported file types
   - Implemented `extractFromHTML()` method
   - Added HTML MIME type support in `isSupportedAdvanced()`
   - Integrated turndown library for HTML to Markdown conversion
   - Added turndown-plugin-gfm for proper table handling

2. **`src/services/fileProcessor.js`**
   - Added HTML processing logic in `convertDocumentToMarkdown()`
   - Integrated same turndown configuration for consistency

3. **`public/js/modules/documents-module.js`**
   - Added HTML file icons (`html`, `htm`) to `getFileIcon()` method

4. **`package.json`**
   - Added `turndown` dependency for HTML to Markdown conversion
   - Added `turndown-plugin-gfm` for GitHub Flavored Markdown support (tables, etc.)

### Features Implemented

#### HTML to Markdown Conversion
- **Headings**: H1-H6 converted to ATX-style markdown (`#`, `##`, etc.)
- **Lists**: Unordered and ordered lists properly formatted
- **Code Blocks**: Fenced code blocks with language detection
- **Tables**: Full table support with proper markdown formatting
- **Links**: Preserved with markdown link syntax
- **Text Formatting**: Bold, italic, strikethrough maintained
- **Blockquotes**: Properly converted to markdown blockquotes
- **Images**: Alt text and URLs preserved
- **Line Breaks**: Handled appropriately

#### Configuration Options
```javascript
{
    headingStyle: 'atx',           // Use # style headings
    codeBlockStyle: 'fenced',      // Use ``` code blocks
    bulletListMarker: '- ',        // Use - for bullet points
    emDelimiter: '*',              // Use * for emphasis
    strongDelimiter: '**'          // Use ** for strong text
}
```

#### Content Cleanup
- Removes HTML comments
- Normalizes excessive whitespace
- Preserves semantic structure
- Handles malformed HTML gracefully

### Usage

HTML files can now be uploaded through any of the existing upload mechanisms:

1. **Web Interface**: Drag and drop or file selection
2. **MCP Service**: Via `uploadFile()` method
3. **API Endpoints**: Through existing file upload endpoints

### Processing Flow

1. **File Upload**: HTML file received by the system
2. **Detection**: File identified as HTML by extension (`.html`, `.htm`) or MIME type (`text/html`)
3. **Conversion**: HTML content converted to clean Markdown using turndown
4. **Chunking**: Markdown content split into semantic chunks
5. **Embedding**: Text chunks converted to vector embeddings
6. **Storage**: Embeddings stored in Qdrant with metadata

### Error Handling

- Graceful fallback for malformed HTML
- Detailed logging for debugging
- Error messages preserved in document metadata
- Continues processing even if conversion fails partially

### Dependencies

- **turndown**: Main HTML to Markdown conversion library
- **turndown-plugin-gfm**: GitHub Flavored Markdown extensions (tables, strikethrough, etc.)

## Testing

The implementation has been thoroughly tested with:
- Complex HTML documents with tables, lists, and formatting
- Malformed HTML handling
- Large file processing
- Memory efficiency verification

## Future Enhancements

1. **Custom Conversion Rules**: Add support for specific HTML elements
2. **Content Extraction**: Better handling of navigation, footers, etc.
3. **Image Processing**: OCR for embedded images in HTML
4. **Style Preservation**: Better handling of CSS-styled content

## Performance Considerations

- HTML files are processed in-memory for speed
- Large files (>50MB) are rejected to prevent memory issues
- Conversion is efficient with minimal overhead
- Chunking optimized for semantic coherence

*This implementation ensures that HTML documents are fully searchable and can be included in semantic search operations alongside other document types.*
