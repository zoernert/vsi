# VSI Agent System - Production Error Fix

## Problem Summary

You were experiencing an `AggregateError` with Axios network connections in your VSI Agent System on the production server. The error occurred in the `OrchestratorAgent.analyzeResearchScope` method when trying to make HTTP requests to `/api/collections`.

```
AggregateError
    at AxiosError.from (/opt/vsi/node_modules/axios/dist/node/axios.cjs:863:14)
    at async OrchestratorAgent.analyzeResearchScope (/opt/vsi/src/agents/OrchestratorAgent.js:51:41)
```

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. **Duplicate Method Definitions** ‚ùå
- The `OrchestratorAgent.js` file had duplicate `analyzeResearchScope` method definitions
- This caused unexpected behavior and method conflicts

### 2. **Network Connectivity Issues** ‚ùå  
- Agents were trying to connect to `localhost:3000` which might not be accessible in the production environment
- Missing or incorrect `API_BASE_URL` environment variable configuration
- Insufficient error handling and retry logic for network failures

### 3. **Missing Production Configuration** ‚ùå
- No production-specific environment variables
- Inadequate timeout and retry settings for production network conditions

## Fixes Applied

### 1. **Fixed Duplicate Methods** ‚úÖ
- **File**: `src/agents/OrchestratorAgent.js`
- **Action**: Removed the duplicate empty `analyzeResearchScope` method
- **Impact**: Ensures the correct method implementation is used

### 2. **Enhanced Network Configuration** ‚úÖ
- **File**: `src/services/agentApiClient.js`
- **Changes**:
  - Improved base URL resolution with production support
  - Increased timeout from 30s to 60s for production environments
  - Added IPv4 family preference and connection validation
  - Enhanced error logging with network-specific debugging

### 3. **Added Retry Logic** ‚úÖ
- **File**: `src/agents/OrchestratorAgent.js`
- **Changes**:
  - Added `retryRequest` method with exponential backoff
  - Integrated retry logic into `analyzeResearchScope` and `findRelevantCollections`
  - Enhanced error reporting with network diagnostics

### 4. **Improved Error Handling** ‚úÖ
- Added specific handling for `ECONNREFUSED` and `ENOTFOUND` errors
- Better logging for debugging network issues
- Graceful fallbacks when API requests fail

### 5. **Production Environment Setup** ‚úÖ
- Created production environment configuration script
- Added diagnostic tools for troubleshooting connectivity

## Files Modified

1. **`src/agents/OrchestratorAgent.js`**
   - Removed duplicate method definition
   - Added retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Enhanced error handling and logging

2. **`src/services/agentApiClient.js`**
   - Improved base URL resolution
   - Enhanced network configuration
   - Better error reporting and debugging

3. **Created diagnostic scripts**:
   - `scripts/diagnose-agent-connectivity.js`
   - `scripts/setup-production-environment.sh`
   - `scripts/quick-fix-production.js`

## How to Apply the Fix

### Option 1: Quick Fix (Recommended)
```bash
cd /opt/vsi
node scripts/quick-fix-production.js
# Restart your VSI application
```

### Option 2: Manual Steps
1. **Restart your VSI application** to load the code changes
2. **Set environment variables**:
   ```bash
   export API_BASE_URL="http://localhost:3000"
   export NODE_ENV="production"
   export AGENT_TIMEOUT="300000"
   ```
3. **Test connectivity**:
   ```bash
   node scripts/diagnose-agent-connectivity.js
   ```

### Option 3: Full Production Setup
```bash
cd /opt/vsi
chmod +x scripts/setup-production-environment.sh
./scripts/setup-production-environment.sh
```

## Verification Steps

1. **Test the health endpoint**:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
   ```

2. **Run the diagnostic script**:
   ```bash
   node scripts/diagnose-agent-connectivity.js
   ```

3. **Try creating an agent session** and monitor the logs for:
   - Successful API connections
   - No more AggregateError messages
   - Proper retry behavior if network issues occur

## Environment Variables for Production

Add these to your production environment:

```bash
# Network Configuration
API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
NODE_ENV=production

# Agent Configuration  
AGENT_TIMEOUT=300000
AGENT_MAX_RETRIES=5
AGENT_RETRY_DELAY=5000

# Server Binding (if needed)
HOST=0.0.0.0
BIND_ADDRESS=0.0.0.0
```

## Monitoring

After applying the fix, monitor your logs for:

‚úÖ **Success indicators**:
- `üîó AgentApiClient initialized with baseURL: http://localhost:3000`
- `‚úÖ Agent execution completed`
- No AggregateError messages

‚ùå **Issues to watch for**:
- Connection refused errors
- Timeout messages
- Retry attempts (some are normal, excessive retries indicate issues)

## Support

If you continue experiencing issues:

1. **Check the diagnostic output**:
   ```bash
   node scripts/diagnose-agent-connectivity.js
   ```

2. **Verify your VSI server is running**:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
   ```

3. **Check if the server is bound to the correct interface**:
   ```bash
   netstat -tlnp | grep :3000
   ```

The fix addresses the core network connectivity and code structure issues that were causing the AggregateError in your production environment.
