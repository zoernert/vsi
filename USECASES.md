# VSI Vector Store Use Cases to API Mapping

## âœ… **Complete Modular Frontend Architecture** 

The VSI Vector Store frontend has been restructured into a **well-organized modular library** that separates concerns based on use cases and provides reusable components.

### **New Modular Structure:**

#### **Core Layer (`/js/core/`)**
- `vsi-core.js` - Main application orchestrator and dependency injection container

#### **Services Layer (`/js/services/`)**
- `api-service.js` - Centralized API communication with all backend endpoints

#### **Modules Layer (`/js/modules/`)**
- `auth-module.js` - User authentication and profile management
- `collections-module.js` - Collection CRUD operations and dashboard
- `documents-module.js` - Document management and file operations
- `search-module.js` - Global and collection-specific search functionality
- `chat-module.js` - AI chat interface and conversation management
- `admin-module.js` - Administrative operations and user management
- `usage-module.js` - Usage statistics and tier management
- `ui-module.js` - Common UI utilities and component factories

#### **Utilities Layer (`/js/utils/`)**
- `vsi-utils.js` - Common utility functions and helpers

#### **Styling (`/css/`)**
- `vsi-styles.css` - Extracted CSS styles for better organization

#### **Global Entry Point**
- `vsi-init.js` - Application initialization and global function wrappers

### **Key Architectural Benefits:**

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each module handles a specific use case domain
2. **Dependency Injection**: Core app provides services to all modules
3. **Reusability**: Modules can be easily reused in other HTML applications
4. **Maintainability**: Clear structure makes debugging and updates easier
5. **Scalability**: New modules can be added without affecting existing code
6. **Testing**: Individual modules can be unit tested independently

### **Reusability Example:**

The modular structure allows for easy reuse. For example, to create a minimal search-only application:

```html
<!-- Minimal VSI Search App -->
<script src="js/utils/vsi-utils.js"></script>
<script src="js/services/api-service.js"></script>
<script src="js/modules/ui-module.js"></script>
<script src="js/modules/auth-module.js"></script>
<script src="js/modules/search-module.js"></script>
<script src="js/core/vsi-core.js"></script>
<script>
    const searchApp = new VSIApp();
    searchApp.init();
</script>
```

## **Use Case to Module Mapping:**

| Use Case Category | Module | Key Responsibilities |
|------------------|---------|---------------------|
| **User Handling** | `auth-module.js` | Login, registration, profile management, authentication |
| **Collections Management** | `collections-module.js` | Collection CRUD, dashboard, collection details |
| **Content Management** | `documents-module.js` | File upload, document operations, text creation |
| **AI-LLM Chat & Search** | `search-module.js`, `chat-module.js` | Semantic search, AI conversations, similarity |
| **Admin Operations** | `admin-module.js` | User management, system monitoring, admin dashboard |
| **System Health & Monitoring** | `usage-module.js` | Usage statistics, health checks, tier management |

The frontend is now **production-ready** with a **clean, modular architecture** that can be easily maintained, extended, and reused across different applications while providing complete coverage of all VSI Vector Store use cases.

## ðŸš€ **Future Backend Architecture (In Progress)**

The backend is currently being refactored towards a modern, scalable, and maintainable architecture based on **Dependency Injection (DI)** and the **Controller-Service-Repository** pattern. The goal is to mirror the modularity and separation of concerns achieved in the frontend.

### **Target Backend Structure:**

- **`src/index.js`**: Main server entry point. Will be simplified to only handle server setup, middleware registration, and routing.
- **`src/container/`**: Contains the Dependency Injection container setup (`setup.js`).
- **`src/controllers/`**: Handles incoming HTTP requests, validates input, and calls application services. (e.g., `CollectionController.js`)
- **`src/services/application/`**: Contains the core business logic and orchestrates operations between repositories. (e.g., `CollectionApplicationService.js`)
- **`src/repositories/`**: Manages data access and communication with the database (PostgreSQL) and vector store (Qdrant). (e.g., `CollectionRepository.js`)
- **`src/routes/`**: Defines API endpoints and maps them to controller methods.

### **Current Status:**

The refactoring is partially complete. The new services, repositories, and controllers have been created, and the DI container is set up in `src/container/setup.js`.

However, the main server file (`src/index.js`) has not yet been updated to use this new structure. It still contains monolithic route handlers with business logic mixed in.

**The next step is to wire up the new architecture in `index.js` by:**
1. Initializing the DI container.
2. Creating API routes that use the controllers from the container.
3. Removing the old, monolithic route handlers from `index.js`.

This will resolve architectural inconsistencies and make the backend as clean and maintainable as the frontend.
